	<p class="orderdesc1"> "Lightweavers are the Radiants most interested in the arts, including all kinds of visual arts and theater. They range widely in personality from the quiet and introspective painter to the outgoing and gregarious stage performer, with everything in between. What unites them tends to be a love of art, though there are some few who are more interested in intrigue, secrets, and espionage. They are the spies of the Knights Radiant and are often untrusted by others (such as the stoic Skybreakers) for their love of subterfuge. They have a reputation for having looser morals than other orders, but the Lightweavers are quick to point out that their personal values are strong. They just don't feel they need to match what other more hardline orders tend to require. They can be vague with oaths, and many say there is far more Cultivation in them than Honor. (Others dispute this, saying that all orders have an equal mix, despite some spren naming themselves "honorspren.") Lightweavers tend to be f		ree spirits, and many among their order see the importance of entertainment, beauty, and art in a person's life, and strive to make sure that the world doesn't just live through the Desolations - because mere survival isn't enough unless there is something to live for." - Brandon Sanderson </p>
  	<p class="orderdesc"> There is currently only one living confirmed Lightweavers, Shallan, but Hoid has similar powers. As their motto states, their goal is to find and speak their personal truths. They gain increased abilities as they speak their truths to their spren. For the Lightweavers, only one ideal exists. Instead of the other four ideals, they speak their personal truths. Their ideal is:</p>
	<ol>
	  <li><p class="orderdesc">"Life before death, strength before weakness, journey before destination."</p></li>
	</ol>
	<p class="orderdesc">Like all orders, Lightweavers have two powers, known as surges; plus shardplate, and shardblades. Their surges are Illumination and Transformation. Illumination is used to create visual or auditory illusions. Transformation is the ability to change one thing into another provided the object is willing to do so. It has been replicated through fabrials.</p>
