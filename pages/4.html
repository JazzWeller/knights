	<p class="orderdesc1"> "The Edgedancers are known as being caring and graceful. Among the Knights Radiant, they see it as their duty to care for the people and are often less interested in war than they are about trying to improve the daily lives of the common folk. Often, a mid-sized town would have an Edgedancer or two on permanent assignment, where they'd use Regrowth to provide healing and would work for the common good of the town.

	Edgedancers tend to be among the more religious of Radiants and are the order where one is most likely to find former religious leaders who end up bonding a spren. During wartime, they often act as the mobile medics, eschewing actual combat to heal or pull out the wounded or those trapped in terrible situations. However, there are some renowned for their graceful and skilled prowess in combat, occasionally used as scouts or special forces troops in conjunction with a team of Windrunners or Skybreakers. One should never assume the Edgedancers are in any way base just because they often ignore high society; they are renowned as some of the most refined and graceful of Radiants." - Brandon Sanderson </p>
  	<p class="orderdesc"> There is currently only one confirmed Edgedancer, Lift. As their motto implies, their goal is remember the ordinary people of the world, and serve them. They gain increased abilities as they swear oaths to their spren focused on that theme, known as ideals. There are five ideals and three are known for the Edgedancers. They are not known to vary their ideals, although it may be possible. The first ideal gives access to both Edgedancer powers, and each successive ideal sworn increases those powers. Their ideals are:</p>
	<ol>
	  <li><p class="orderdesc">"Life before death, strength before weakness, journey before destination."</p></li>
	  <li><p class="orderdesc">"I will remember those who have been forgotten."</p></li>
	  <li><p class="orderdesc">"I will listen to those who have been ignored."</p></li>
	</ol>
	<p class="orderdesc">Like all orders, Edgedancers have two powers, known as surges; plus shardplate, and shardblades. Their surges are Abrasion, and Progression. Abrasion affects friction, either reducing it, or increasing it on various surfaces or objects. Progression affects speed and biological growth and repair. They can use this power to go without food without harming themselves.</p>
