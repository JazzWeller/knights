	<p class="orderdesc1"> "The Truthwatchers are seen as quiet, largely known as the most scholarly order of Knights Radiant. They tend to attract scientists primarily, but also scholars or thinkers of all types. This extends to some who might not normally be known as scholarly but instead as someone often consumed by their own thoughts. In general, they tend to be reserved, particularly in person, though a small minority of Truthwatchers are greatly concerned with the actions of the powerful and might be likened to investigative reporters. These make their opinions known loudly and forcefully, particularly if they think someone in power is abusing that power or lying about fundamental truths. Note that, as with all Knights Radiant, there is great disagreement within the order about what is the truth. However, Truthwatchers tend to approach these discussions with enthusiasm, even if they generally prefer to write their opinions rather than speak them. Among the Knights Radiant, the Truthwatchers tend to be thos	e who hold the knowledge and secrets of Surgebinding and are the ones to discover many of the newer advances in things like fabrial technology." - Brandon Sanderson </p>
  	<p class="orderdesc"> There are currently two confirmed Truthwatchers, Renarin Kholin, and The Stump. As their motto states, their goal is to seek and potentially spread eternal truths. They gain increased abilities as they swear oaths to their spren focused on that theme, known as ideals. There are five ideals but only one is known for the Truthwatchers. They are not known to vary their ideals, although it may be possible. Their ideals are:</p>
	<ol>
	  <li><p class="orderdesc">"Life before death, strength before weakness, journey before destination."</p></li>
	</ol>
	<p class="orderdesc">Like all orders, Truthwatchers have two powers, known as surges; plus shardplate, and shardblades. Their surges are Progression, and Illumination. Progression affects speed and biological growth and repair. They can potentially use this power to go without food without harming themselves. Illumination is used to create visual or auditory illusions.</p>
