	<p class="orderdesc1"> "The Willshapers have a reputation for attracting builders, craftspeople, and creators to the Radiants. However, while this aspect of them is accurate, the actual membership of the order is far more varied. Their powers lend themselves to creation, true, but their oaths are focused on freedom and personal fulfillment. Many among the Willshapers are warriors focused on freeing those who are captive, and others are focused on radical self-expression. The Willshapers contain many gregarious and even flamboyant characters who make their own way, taking the path they choose. They are united through a love of building, but some consider the building of society to be more important than the building of structures. Among the Willshapers, there are both those who dress very conservatively and those who wear very daring and original styles. The common ground is that both agree that freedom to express who you are is the important part. Among the Radiants, they are generally focused on building, t	raining, and making infrastructure. In war, they might be sent to a town to fortify it against an oncoming invasion. Before or in the wake of Desolations, they would teach the people things like sanitation, bronzeworking, or other essentials. Anywhere one finds someone resisting tyranny or oppression, one will often find a Willshaper cheering them on." - Brandon Sanderson </p>
  	<p class="orderdesc"> There are no known Willshapers. As their motto states, their goal is to allow everyone freedom. They gain increased abilities as they swear oaths to their spren focused on that theme, known as ideals. Of the five total ideals, only one is known for the Willshapers. Their ideals are:</p>
	<ol>
	  <li><p class="orderdesc">"Life before death, strength before weakness, journey before destination."</p></li>
	</ol>
	<p class="orderdesc">Like all orders, Willshapers have two powers, known as surges; plus shardplate, and shardblades. Their surges are Transportation, and Cohesion. Transportation potentially allows teleportation, but not much is known about this surge. Cohesion allows for odd manipulations of the states of matter, such as walking through walls as if they were liquid.</p>
