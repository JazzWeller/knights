	<p class="orderdesc1"> "Dustbringers - though they sometimes objected to the common name for their order, preferring instead to be called Releasers - are living contradictions among the Knights Radiant. They believe great power requires a strong will to control it. They often attract tinkerers who like to dig down into the shape and soul of a thing, break it, and see what makes it work. However, their oaths are themed toward control - that they need to be able to control, contain, and channel the terrible power inside them. They tend to object to those who focus only on their destructive sides, as they argue that in order to create, one must understand the pieces of the thing they are trying to make. They don't see themselves as being about destruction - though their powers are the most destructive of any order of Knights Radiant. They instead see their nature as being about control, precision, and understanding. In the Knights Radiant, they tend to act as the equivalent of artillery in a modern army. If one wants a large swath of land destroyed or burned, one calls in the Dustbringers. However, they were also often used as sappers, engineers, and strategists.<br><br> They attract anyone who likes to take things apart, who likes to know how things work. They also attract those who are a little foolhardy at times - brave soldiers who see themselves as containing and controlling terrible destruction so it won't get out of hand and hurt innocents."<br>  - Brandon Sanderson </p>
  	<p class="orderdesc"> There is currently only one known example of a dustbringer, Malata. As their motto implies, their goal is to control themselves, and more importantly the powers they control. They gain increased abilities as they swear oaths to their spren focused on that theme, known as ideals. There are five ideals and only the first is known for the Dustbringers. They may very somewhat, with the exception of the first. The first ideal gives access to one Dustbringer power, and each successive ideal sworn increases that power. After swearing some further ideal they are granted their second power. The ideals are:</p>
	<ol>
	  <li><p class="orderdesc">"Life before death, strength before weakness, journey before destination."</p></li>
	</ol>
	<p class="orderdesc">Like all orders, Skybreakers have two powers, known as surges; plus shardplate, and shardblades. Their surges are division, and abrasion. Division seperates, decays, or destroys. This includes burning things, crushing them to dust, or degrading them. Abrasion affects friction, either reducing it, or increasing it on various surfaces or objects.</p>
