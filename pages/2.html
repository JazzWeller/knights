	<p class="orderdesc1"> "The Skybreakers were the enforcers of the Knights Radiant, often tasked with keeping the peace, policing the other orders, and making certain that dangerous or dark forces in the world were contained. This sometimes gave them a bad reputation among the more free-thinking orders of Knights, but the Skybreakers (at their best) were not merciless. They were the ones who believed that nobody, not even a Radiant, should be above being questioned. They were the ones that did the sometimes tough job of making certain that the orders didn't abuse their power to become tyrants, as the Skybreakers saw that those with powers could easily oppress those who had none. <br><br> They tend to attract those who believe in the importance of legal code, those who have strong moral codes of their own, and those who think the best defense against anarchy are things like patriotism, moral fiber, and rules to govern behavior. Note that the current incarnation, led by the Herald Nale in his madness, is more rigid than the ancient order, which understood that the law was not perfect, but instead represented an ideal to try to reach over time. Anyone believing in finding true justice, in defending the innocent, and in punishing the guilty would be welcome in the order." - Brandon Sanderson </p>
  	<p class="orderdesc"> Skybreakers are the only order to have survived since the ancient days, currently led by Nale. As their motto states, their goal is seek and enforce justice. They gain increased abilities as they swear oaths to their spren focused on that theme, known as ideals. There are five ideals and all five are known for the Skybreakers. They may very somewhat significantly, with the exception of the first. The first ideal gives access to one skybreaker power, and each successive ideal sworn increases that power. The third ideal grants their second power. The ideals are:</p>
	<ol>
	  <li><p class="orderdesc">"Life before death, strength before weakness, journey before destination."</p></li>
	  <li><p class="orderdesc">"I will put the law before all else."</p></li>
	  <li><p class="orderdesc">"I dedicate myself to a greater truth."</p></li>
	  <li><p class="orderdesc"> This ideal is a personal oath knwon as the Ideal of Crusade, where a Skybreaker undertakes a personal quest.</p></li>
	  <li><p class="orderdesc">"I will be law personified."</p></li>
	</ol>
	<p class="orderdesc">Like all orders, Skybreakers have two powers, known as surges; plus shardplate, and shardblades. Their surges are gravitation, and division. Gravitation allows them to change the gravity, direction and magnitude, of a person or object. Division seperates, decays, or destroys. This includes burning things, crushing them to dust, or degrading them.</p>
