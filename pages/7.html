	<p class="orderdesc1"> "Thoughtful, careful, and cautious, the Elsecallers are generally regarded as the wisest of the Radiants. They seek self-improvement and personal betterment in their lives, but aren't limited to one specific theme or set of Ideals. This makes them one of the most open and welcoming of orders, though they do tend to attract those who are less flamboyant. They have their share of scholars, and often a large number of theologians, but also attract those who are interested in leadership. They are good at encouraging others, but some are known to set their sights upon the things they want and then seize them. In the Knights Radiant, they tend to be among the best tacticians, and are logistical geniuses, aided in part by their abilities to create food and water for armies, but also their ability to move in and out of Shadesmar." - Brandon Sanderson </p>
  	<p class="orderdesc"> There is currently only one known Elsecaller, Jasnah Kholin. As their motto states, their goal is to improve themselves and reach their potential. They gain increased abilities as they swear oaths to their spren focused on that theme, known as ideals. Of the five total ideals, only one is known for the Elsecallers. Their ideals are:</p>
	<ol>
	  <li><p class="orderdesc">"Life before death, strength before weakness, journey before destination."</p></li>
	</ol>
	<p class="orderdesc">Like all orders, Elsecallers have two powers, known as surges; plus shardplate, and shardblades. Their surges are Transformation, and Transportation. Transformation is the ability to change one thing into another provided the object is willing to do so. It has been replicated through fabrials. Transportation potentially allows teleportation, but not much is known about this surge.</p>
