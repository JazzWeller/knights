	<p class="orderdesc1"> "Anyone can become a Bondsmith, subject to persuading one of the three spren who grant Bondsmith powers. Those powers tend to work differently for one Bondsmith than another, and even those Surges they share with other orders tend to work differently for Bondsmiths. <br><Br>The Bondsmiths are unusual in that there are never more than three full members. Historically, they worked to resolve disputes and help set up functioning governments. Even though there can only be three full members, there were times that some Bondsmiths did take squires. Beyond that, many of the retinues that protected the Bondsmiths were considered members of the order - going so far as to swear oaths, even though they didn't have a spren and never would. Some even called this the most pure form of being a Radiant, because these were oaths sworn not in the name of gaining powers, but simply for the good of the oaths themselves. <br><br> Bondsmiths are generally the heart and soul of the Radiants, the most protected and highly regarded of the orders, capable of doing incredible things with the nature of oaths, bonds, and power. The order, including the aforementioned squires and attendants, tends to attract the peacemakers of the world, those who want to bring people together rather than divide them." - Brandon Sanderson </p>
  	<p class="orderdesc"> There are two known Bondsmiths, Dalinar Kholin, and Navani Kholin. They do not have a unified goal, which is ironic considering their motto is to unite. They gain increased abilities as they swear oaths to their spren focused on that theme, known as ideals. Of the five total ideals, three are known for the Bondsmiths. Their ideals are:</p>
	<ol>
	  <li><p class="orderdesc">"Life before death, strength before weakness, journey before destination."</p></li>
	  <li><p class="orderdesc">"I will unite instead of divide. I will bring men together."</p></li>
	  <li><p class="orderdesc">"I will take responsibility for what I have done. If I must fall, I will rise each time a better man."</p></li>
	</ol>
	<p class="orderdesc">Like all orders, Bondsmiths have two powers, known as surges; plus shardplate, and shardblades. Their surges are Tension, and Adhesion. Tension's usages are unknown. Adhesion binds two or more things together, or, should they not be touching, pulls them together.</p>
