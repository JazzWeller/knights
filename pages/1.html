	<p class="orderdesc1"> "The Windrunners tend to attract "big sibling" types, who seek to protect the defenseless, but also enjoy action and fighting for what they believe in. They're primarily scouts, though they often work as special forces groups, able to deliver teams of Radiants behind enemy lines for secret missions. They tend to be the most like conventional soldiers, believing in structures of command, team dynamics, and the importance of a squad of brothers and sisters. They often have larger numbers of squires than other orders and focus more than any other order on mastering their weapons." - Brandon Sanderson </p>
  	<p class="orderdesc"> Windrunners in the modern day are led by Kaladin. As their motto states, their goal is to protect others. They gain increased abilities as they swear oaths to their spren focused on that theme, known as ideals. There are five ideals and four are known for the Windrunners. They may very slightly, with the exception of the first. The first ideal gives access to windrunner powers, and each successive ideal sworn increases those powers. The fourth ideal grants shardplate. The ideals are:</p>
	<ol>
	  <li><p class="orderdesc">"Life before death, strength before weakness, journey before destination."</p></li>
	  <li><p class="orderdesc">"I will protect those who cannot protect themselves."</p></li>
	  <li><p class="orderdesc">"I will protect even those I hate so long as it is right."</p></li>
	  <li><p class="orderdesc">"I accept that there will be those I cannot protect."</p></li>
	</ol>
	<p class="orderdesc">Like all orders, Windrunners have two powers, known as surges; plus shardplate, and shardblades. Their surges are gravitation, and adhesion. Gravitation allows them to change the gravity, direction and magnitude, of a person or object. Adhesion binds two or more things together, or, should they not be touching, pulls them together.</p>
