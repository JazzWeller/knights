	<p class="orderdesc1"> "Stonewards are the infantry and ground troops of the Radiants and are renowned as their finest soldiers. (A title that, on occasion, the Windrunners dispute.) They tend to attract those who are most interested in warfare, prowess with weapons, or athletics of any sort. They like a challenge, and in times of peace are seen engaging in (and running) various sporting events of both a military and non-military nature. Many enjoy the outdoors, and one will find exploration enthusiasts among them, as well as those who just like the fresh air. They tend to be known for their can-do attitudes and for taking on enormous projects (sometimes more than they can handle). However, most agree that the primary attribute of the Stonewards is their dependability. Though sometimes gregarious, they are never flighty. If a Stoneward is one's friend, they will be there for such a friend, and that is a core tenet of their order - to be there when they are needed. Another key attribute is their ability to ta		ke a difficult situation with few resources and make something better of it. Though not known as inventors or creators, they are good at improvising solutions to problems in the moment." - Brandon Sanderson </p>
  	<p class="orderdesc"> There are no known Stonewards. As their motto states, their goal is to be there when needed, and to help whoever they can. They gain increased abilities as they swear oaths to their spren focused on that theme, known as ideals. Of the five total ideals, only one is known for the Stonewards. Their ideals are:</p>
	<ol>
	  <li><p class="orderdesc">"Life before death, strength before weakness, journey before destination."</p></li>
	</ol>
	<p class="orderdesc">Like all orders, Stonewards have two powers, known as surges; plus shardplate, and shardblades. Their surges are Cohesion, and Tension. Cohesion allows for odd manipulations of the states of matter, such as walking through walls as if they were liquid. Tension's usages are unknown.</p>
